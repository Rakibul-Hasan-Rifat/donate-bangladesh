          What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="text-justify">
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
            documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of
            objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document,
            such as an element, attribute, or text. This allows programming
            languages like JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the
            content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically. <br />

            Here's a simple breakdown: <br />

            Document: The entire HTML or XML document. <br />

            Object: Each part of the document (elements, attributes, text) is
            represented as an object. <br />

            Model: The document is modeled as a tree structure, where each node
            is an object. <br />

            For example, in an HTML document, the &lt;body&gt; tag and its
            contents are represented as objects that can be accessed and
            manipulated using the DOM. This enables developers to create
            interactive and dynamic web pages by adding, removing, or modifying
            elements and their attributes.

          How do you select an element from the DOM?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Selecting an element from the DOM can be done using various methods
            in JavaScript. Here are some common ways: <br />
            1. getElementById: Selects an element by its ID. <br />
            2. getElementsByClassName: Selects all elements with a specific
            class name. <br />
            3. getElementsByTagName: Selects all elements with a specific tag
            name. <br />
            4. querySelector: Selects the first element that matches a CSS
            selector. <br />
            5. querySelectorAll: Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.
            <br />
            <br />
            These methods allow you to interact with and manipulate elements on
            your web page dynamically.

          What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it
          useful?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p class="text-justify">
            Event delegation is a technique in the DOM that allows you to handle
            events at a higher level in the DOM tree rather than attaching event
            listeners to individual elements. This is particularly useful when
            you have many elements that need to respond to the same event, or
            when elements are dynamically added to the DOM. <br />
            <br />

            <strong>How It Works: </strong> <br />
            1. Event Bubbling: When an event occurs on an element, it first runs
            the handlers on that element, then on its parent, and so on up the
            DOM tree. This is known as event bubbling. <br />
            2. Single Event Listener: Instead of adding an event listener to
            each child element, you add a single event listener to a common
            ancestor. This ancestor can then handle events for all its
            descendants. <br />

          <p class="text-justify">
            Manipulating an element's attributes and styles using the DOM can be done easily with JavaScript. Here are some common methods: <br> <br>
            <strong>Manipulating Attributes</strong> <br>
            1. getAttribute: Retrieves the value of an attribute. <br>
            2. setAttribute: Sets the value of an attribute. <br>
            3. removeAttribute: Removes an attribute. <br> <br>

            <strong>Manipulating Styles</strong> <br>
            1. Directly Setting Styles: You can directly set styles using the style property. <br>
            2. Using classList: Add, remove, or toggle classes to change styles. <br>
